### About Work

I work with web development since **2009** and more specifically with **Ruby on Rails** since **2011** and with **PostgresSQL** since **2008**.

### About Books

I like books about science fiction (**Asimov**, Frank Herbert and, more recently, **John Scalzi** and Martha Wells), fantasy (**Tolkien** is the best), finance, technology, biographies, and many others.

### About Music

I like to work listening to mostly Metallica, Black Sabbath, Raul Seixas, and, more recently, Gojira and Sepultura.

### About Personal Projects

I have a new idea for a big project every weekday and the pile of them are starting to look at me in a very strange way (just like the pile of unread books).

Oh, I have a small bakery with my brother. It's kinda cool.
